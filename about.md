#### Problem landscape visualizations: ####
* *Problem landscape* as a combination between *dominance ratio* (blue) and *violation landscape* (pink).
* *Dominance ratio* for each sampled solution expressed as a proportion of sampled solutions that dominate it.
* *Violation landscape* in terms of constraint violation values whit the feasible region presented in white.
* *All solutions* in the objective space where blue indicates the objective values that can be obtained with feasible solutions, while pink color indicates solutions that can be obtained with infeasible solutions only.
* *Non-dominated solutions* in the objective space where the unconstrained Pareto front is depicted in pink and the constrained Pareto front in blue.

#### Visualizations of separate features: ####
* Violin plots showing feature distributions for each test suite and various dimensionality (2, 3, 5, any).

Symbol | Feature

\\(a^2\\)| a

#### Visualizations of multiple features: ####
* Feature space visualization using dimensionality reduction methods: PCA, Isomap, MDS, and t-SNE.
